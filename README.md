# 2014_Sales Analysis (Interactive Dashboard Creation Using Excel)

## Project Overview
This dashboard provides a comprehensive visualization of sales data from the year 2014, allowing stakeholders to monitor performance, identify high-performing products and salespersons, and evaluate logistics and order priorities across months.

## Dataset 
Due to data sensitivity, raw data is not included.

## KPIs
-	Highlights which products are most frequently ordered	
-	Shows the revenue generated by top selling products	
-	Evaluates performance by revenue generation	
-	Compares shipping cost by delivery method	
-	Helps understand demand urgency

## Process
-	Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used
-	Created pivot tables according to the questions asked
-	Merge all pivot tables into one dashboard and apply slicer to make dynamic


## Project Insight
-	SKU381 has the highest sales revenue, but isn’t among the top in quantity ordered — indicating it is a high-value item
-	SKU516 is highest selling product
-	Richard significantly outperforms others
-	Delivery Truck is the most expensive mode



## Conclusion  
Prioritize marketing and stock availability for high-value items. Maintain higher inventory levels of fast selling to ensure consistent sales.  Shipping cost by Delivery Truck is disproportionately high — alternative modes or bulk shipping might reduce costs.
